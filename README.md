# üëã Hi, I'm Shaan! 

14 y/o that loves building robust, low-level systems from the ground up. Passionate about systems programming, compilers, operating systems and high-performance code.

## Projects

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve applied my skills to build projects that push boundaries and tackle ambitious challenges:

### [Bract](https://github.com/101shaan/Bract)
**A fast, memory safe systems programming language.**  
**Technologies used:**  
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=flat&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white)

Bract is an experimental systems programming language written in Rust. It‚Äôs built to test the idea of integrating memory management strategies and performance contracts directly into the type system. The compiler is in early development: it can lex, parse, build an AST, run basic semantic checks, and emit native code via Cranelift, but many features are incomplete or just placeholders. Right now, Bract is a correctness-first research project ‚Äî performance is secondary, and production use is nowhere on the horizon.

### [ShaanOS](https://github.com/101shaan/ShaanOS)
**A custom x86 operating system kernel written in C and Assembly, featuring memory management, process scheduling, interrupt handling, and basic I/O.**  
**Technologies used:**  
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=flat&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![Assembly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Assembly-6E4C13?style=flat&logo=gnu&logoColor=white)
![NASM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NASM-4B6C4B?style=flat&logo=gnubash&logoColor=white)
![GDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/GDB-000000?style=flat&logo=gnubash&logoColor=white)
![GCC](https://img.shields.io/badge/GCC-00599C?style=flat&logo=gnu&logoColor=white)
![QEMU](https://img.shields.io/badge/QEMU-FF6600?style=flat&logo=qemu&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white)

ShaanOS is a 32-bit x86 kernel written in C and Assembly. It implements core OS building blocks ‚Äî memory management, process scheduling, interrupt handling, and basic I/O ‚Äî entirely from scratch. The project is still in development: it boots, sets up paging, handles interrupts, runs a basic shell, and can read from disk, but many components are incomplete or unoptimized. This is a hands-on exploration of low-level systems programming, not a production-ready OS.

### [CIVSIM](https://github.com/101shaan/CIVSIM)
**A Python/Pygame civilization simulation that models the growth and interaction of civilizations.**  
**Technologies used:**  
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white)

CIVSIM is a Python/Pygame civilization simulator. It handles population growth, territory expansion, and interactions like war and diplomacy between civilizations. The UI is functional and detailed, letting you inspect civilizations and toggle views, and GPT integration generates optional lore. It works, it‚Äôs playable, and it‚Äôs exactly what it says on the tin ‚Äî a deep simulation for experimenting with civilizations.

### [DailyGlitch](https://github.com/101shaan/DailyGlitch)    ||    [Live Demo](https://dailyglitch.org)
**A Full-Stack Web App that documents strange occurrences and "glitches in the matrix".**  
**Technologies used:**  
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169E1?style=flat&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=flat&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/TailwindCSS-38B2AC?style=flat&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white)

DailyGlitch is more than a portfolio piece‚Äîit‚Äôs an end-to-end web app, built to capture and share the weird, unexplained so-called "Glitches in the Matrix". The stack brings together PostgreSQL for robust data storage, TypeScript for safe scripting, React for responsive UI, and Tailwind CSS for rapid design iteration. Every feature is crafted to scale and deliver a seamless user experience.

Each of these projects is a direct demonstration of my technical depth and creative ambition‚Äîreal evidence of skill, not just claims.
